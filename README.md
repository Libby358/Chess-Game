# Chess-Game

A strategic two-player game where the user competes against the computer, aiming to checkmate the opponentâ€™s king using tactical and strategic moves. The game follows standard chess rules, with the computer making intelligent decisions based on an AI algorithm.

## Requirements for Coding a User vs. Computer Chess Game

### 1. Board Representation
- The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, with alternating light and dark squares.
- Each piece (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) must be represented with unique identifiers.
- Initial board setup must follow standard chess rules.
- Store board state using a 2D array, FEN notation, or an object-based approach.

### 2. Move Logic
- Implement movement rules for all six types of pieces.
- Include special moves: castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- Check for move legality to prevent invalid moves.
- Ensure moves update the board correctly.

### 3. Game Rules
- Implement the conditions for check, checkmate, and stalemate.
- Recognize and enforce threefold repetition and fifty-move rule draws.
- Ensure king safety at all times.
- Handle pawn promotion to any piece except the king.

### 4. AI Opponent
- Implement a decision-making algorithm for the computer (Minimax with alpha-beta pruning or use an external engine like Stockfish).
- The AI should evaluate board positions based on piece values, mobility, and positional advantages.
- Difficulty levels can be implemented by adjusting AI depth.
- Use heuristics for better decision-making at different stages of the game.

### 5. Turn Management
- Ensure turn-based play (alternating between user and AI).
- Validate that only the correct player's pieces can be moved during their turn.
- Implement move timers if desired.

### 6. UI/UX
- Display the board graphically using a framework (e.g., React, HTML/CSS, Pygame, or JavaFX) or a text-based console version.
- Use drag-and-drop or click-based movement for pieces.
- Highlight legal moves to improve user experience.
- Show captured pieces and move history.

### 7. Input Handling
- Accept user moves via clicks (GUI) or algebraic notation (text-based version).
- Validate user input before execution.
- Implement undo/redo functionality.

### 8. Game State Management
- Maintain game history for undo/redo.
- Store board states to allow save/load functionality.
- Handle move recording in Portable Game Notation (PGN) if needed.

### 9. Timer (Optional)
- Implement a chess clock for competitive play.
- Include adjustable time controls (bullet, blitz, rapid, classical modes).
- Ensure AI considers time constraints for move decisions.

### 10. Undo/Redo (Optional)
- Allow users to take back moves.
- Store previous board states for rollback functionality.
- Limit undo options based on game mode (casual vs. ranked play).

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python, JavaScript, Java, or C++
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Chess.js, Pygame, React, Stockfish API
- **AI Algorithms**: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Neural Networks
- **UI Development**: HTML/CSS, Canvas, React, or Pygame
- **Data Storage**: LocalStorage, SQLite, or JSON for game states

By implementing these features, a fully functional chess game can be developed, offering an engaging and strategic user experience against an AI opponent.
